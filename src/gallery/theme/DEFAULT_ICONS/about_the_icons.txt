About The Icons
---------------

when you add files other than images into the gallery...
these icons will be used instead of a thumbnail.
By default, when file type is not defined in the icons here... it will use the blank "default.gif"

You can add any icons here to display a specific image for the filetype.
You must name the file according to the file extension.
for example... avi.gif  mpg.gif  mov.gif  doc.gif  zip.gif


If you are creating a new theme, you can override any of the default icons by creating a folder "icons" inside the theme folder... e.g. have a look at my grey and dark themes. Works for both folder image and any file icon.
However, if you dont have an icon for a filetype in your "themename/icon" but it is found in "DEFAULT_ICONS" then that is used.

The styles for the deafult themes have been condifgured to the icons size 64 x 64 and thumbnail size 140 x 105
If you want to use different size icons, you will need to edit the CSS styles to align them properly.

The folder.gif folder icon image has to always have the same dimesnsions as the thumbnails.

You can set the folder icon individually for each folder... by dropping a another "folder.gif" inside that folder.

The default icon set here is by Kearone

If you wish to add more icons to the set here... I recommend resizing to 64x64...
and convert to transparent GIF as the PNG support in IE is a bit dodgy to say the least.
