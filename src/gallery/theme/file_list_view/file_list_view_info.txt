this theme demonstrates how to use the file list view...

the folder image icon included with this theme is just resized from the original.
the rest of the file icons are resized in the html img tag from the original larger default icons.

I fyou want the icons looking sweet... resize them or use new smaller ones, and copy them to the icons folder here.
I have not done this to keep the download size a bit smaller.



The settings shown in in the config.php (spcific to file_list_view) can be copied to "galleryconfig.php" inside any image folder to use this view for a specific folder.
